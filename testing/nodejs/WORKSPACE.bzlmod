# build_bazel_rules_nodejs provides no Bazel module and is not listed on the
# Bazel Central Registry. The rule set is deprecated in favor of rules_js, so,
# we cannot expect a Bazel module to be created for it.

# TODO[AH] Migrate rules_nixpkgs_nodejs to use rules_js for any JavaScript
# targets, rules_nodejs can still be used for the core functionality, the
# toolchain in particular.
